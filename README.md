# GSoC Meta Tracker: Enable multiple network interfaces for Rook storage providers

This repository contains @giovanism progress and report during GSoC programs.

## Project Abstract

> This project aims to create new API to enable multiple network interface for
> Rook storage providers. Currently, Rook providers only choice is to use
> hostNetwork or not. The new API will be used to define networks resource for
> Rook clusters. Rook operators will be able to consume those definitions and
> manage them. Therefore, it enables more fine-grained control over storage
> providers network access.
